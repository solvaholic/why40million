# Why 40 Million?

40 million Americans have no health insurance. 40 million people suffer anxiety. Taylor Swiftâ€™s cat scratch cost her 40 million dollars. Why is it always 40 million?!

For more about this question, go to https://solvaholic.github.io/why40million/

I'd archived this repo because I lost interest in making the app. I unarchived it because I've developed a new itch in the same area:

"Why 40 million?" was about _40 million_ being a code word connecting mentions and messages I believe were orchestrated to achieve some objective. For example to prime (humans') perceptions by ~subtly recalling associated memories.

Now it's about how a person would go about doing that :point_up:. If I want shoppers in my town to crave a brand or product, or activists to adopt a term or message, how would I go about that? How would I identify available providers and shop their services? How would I pay them, and how much would it cost?
