# The problem @solvaholic imagines
40 million Americans have no health insurance. 40 million people suffer anxiety. Taylor Swift's cat scratch cost her 40 million dollars. Why is it always 40 million?!

# Who has this problem?
'murica.

# What solutions exist?
How would I know, man? It's all a conspiracy, those three-letter government agencies are passing notes to each other and "40 million" is just a code word.

Seriously, if we had imagined pre-existing solutions then this imaginary problem would have been less interesting. I wouldn't go so far as to call this "40 million" thing a conspiracy but be honest: It is a weird coincidence.

# What will we do about it?
Web site. Daily content updates. Automatically search for "40 million" and compute a narrative that ties together 2-4 search results we haven't talked about in the past 7 days.

## (How) Will this solution be better?
Really this is just an excuse to build an app on BlueMix and try some things out with OpenWhisk, Watson, Natural Language Processing, and Natural Language Generation. So, this solution will help me learn and serve as an example others can learn from as well.

## What are the risks in this solution?
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, call my mom's lawyer.
