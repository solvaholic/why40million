# What

In general, what steps will `why40million` follow?

## StartJob

Something has to start the daily process. Go!

## GetPages

## SelectPages

Sort/filter/select 2-4 pages to use for this run. Select resources we haven't used in the past 7 days.

## GenerateStory

Read the selected pages and compute a narrative that ties them together.

## PublishStory

Publish the story. Um .. put it where visitors can browse to it. Maybe also announce it somewhere.

## FinishJob

Probably we're just done. But if there's something to clean up or put away then do that here.
